Scott Pretty is an American actor, born in Coon Rapids, MN.

Untypical of most actors - he did not know he wanted to act until later in his life while serving in the military. While working graveyard shifts, and only sleeping and eating while not at work, he became very depressed.  

Until, that is, he watched a movie. "Unbreakable"  After watching this movie, Scott tried many different things to try and find what he would do with his life. After trying a myriad of different professions, he was offered an Improv class. Which led him to acting.

He now hopes that he can do for someone, what "Unbreakable" did for him. Change his life for the better.
